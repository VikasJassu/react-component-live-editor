# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The React Live Inspector is a browser-based playground that allows frontend engineers and designers to paste arbitrary JSX code, see it render in real-time, select visual elements by clicking, and edit basic properties (text, colors, spacing, borders) with instant preview updates. This tool fills the gap left by existing solutions by providing a lightweight, self-contained React component playground focused purely on live editing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to paste JSX code into a text input and see it rendered as a React component, so that I can quickly prototype and visualize components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pastes valid JSX code into the input area THEN the system SHALL compile and render the component without console errors
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Preview" button THEN the system SHALL display the rendered component within 100ms perceived latency
3. WHEN invalid JSX is provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with line numbers and descriptions
4. WHEN the component renders THEN the system SHALL use React 18 and @babel/standalone for client-side compilation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on any visual element in the rendered component and see it highlighted, so that I can identify which element I want to edit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any DOM element in the preview THEN the system SHALL highlight it with a #2680ff 2px dashed outline
2. WHEN an element is selected THEN the system SHALL prevent event propagation to parent elements
3. WHEN an element is selected THEN the system SHALL populate the inspector panel with that element's editable properties
4. WHEN a user clicks on a different element THEN the system SHALL remove the previous highlight and highlight the new selection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit text content and styling properties in an inspector panel and see changes applied instantly, so that I can iterate quickly on component design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an element is selected THEN the inspector panel SHALL display editable controls for text content, color, backgroundColor, padding, margin, and borderRadius
2. WHEN a user modifies any property in the inspector THEN the preview SHALL update within 100ms
3. WHEN text content is changed THEN the system SHALL update the element's inner text immediately
4. WHEN style properties are modified THEN the system SHALL apply the changes to the element's inline styles
5. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain the element selection and highlight

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save my component and edits to get a shareable URL, so that I can share my work with others or return to it later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Save" THEN the system SHALL serialize the current component state to a backend API
2. WHEN the save operation completes THEN the system SHALL return a unique URL that can be shared
3. WHEN a saved URL is accessed THEN the system SHALL restore the exact component state including all edits
4. WHEN saving fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and offer to retry

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle component compilation securely and efficiently, so that the tool is safe and performant to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSX is compiled THEN the system SHALL use only @babel/standalone with preset-react
2. WHEN rendering components THEN the system SHALL avoid using eval() outside of the Babel transform wrapper
3. WHEN cloning elements for selection THEN the system SHALL inject data-path attributes for element lookup
4. WHEN processing large components THEN the system SHALL avoid deep copies and optimize tree diffing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the inspector to be keyboard accessible and have high contrast visual indicators, so that I can use the tool effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating the inspector THEN all controls SHALL be tab-focusable
2. WHEN elements are highlighted THEN the outline SHALL meet high-contrast accessibility standards
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN users SHALL be able to select elements and modify properties
4. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the inspector controls SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tool to work reliably across modern browsers, so that I can use it regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Chrome 95+ THEN all features SHALL work without compatibility issues
2. WHEN using Firefox 90+ THEN all features SHALL work without compatibility issues
3. WHEN using Safari 15+ THEN all features SHALL work without compatibility issues
4. WHEN browser APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallbacks or clear error messages
